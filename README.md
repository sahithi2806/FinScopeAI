# FinScope AI
FinScope AI is an end-to-end financial data analysis and insight generation system designed to help users understand stock market behavior through data-driven techniques.

The platform integrates real-time market data, statistical analysis, and contextual news to provide a comprehensive view of stock performance. Instead of merely displaying price trends, FinScope AI interprets market movements by combining quantitative indicators such as moving averages, volatility, and percentage change with qualitative signals from financial news.

The system follows a layered architecture:

* **Data Layer**: Fetches historical stock data using financial APIs
* **Analysis Layer**: Computes indicators like moving average, volatility, and trend classification
* **Insight Layer**: Generates human-readable interpretations of stock performance
* **Context Layer**: Retrieves and filters relevant financial news to explain possible causes of price movements
* **Visualization Layer**: Displays trends and indicators through graphical plots

This approach transforms raw financial data into actionable insights, making the platform useful for beginners learning the stock market as well as users seeking quick analytical summaries.
